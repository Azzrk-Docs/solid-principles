**What are SOLID Principles?**

SOLID is an acronym representing five core principles of object-oriented design,These are not design patterns, but design principles for effective object-oriented design while designing a class structure. aimed at making software systems more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles are widely adopted in software development to create robust and scalable applications. Each letter in "SOLID" stands for a different principle :

**1.**    S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**2.**    O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**3.**    L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**4.**    I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**5.**    D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

These principles, when applied correctly, ensure that your code is easy to extend, easy to maintain, and less prone to errors or bugs during future updates.

### Why Are They Important in Flutter Development?

Flutter is a powerful framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. However, as your Flutter applications grow in size and complexity, maintaining high code quality becomes crucial. Hereâ€™s why SOLID principles are important in Flutter development:
