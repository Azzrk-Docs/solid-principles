# Solid Principles

### Introduction :
---

**What are SOLID Principles?**

SOLID is an acronym representing five core principles of object-oriented design,These are not design patterns, but design principles for effective object-oriented design while designing a class structure. aimed at making software systems more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles are widely adopted in software development to create robust and scalable applications. Each letter in "SOLID" stands for a different principle :

**1.**    S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**2.**    O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**3.**    L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**4.**    I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**5.**    D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

These principles, when applied correctly, ensure that your code is easy to extend, easy to maintain, and less prone to errors or bugs during future updates.

### Why Are They Important in Flutter Development?
---
Flutter is a powerful framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. However, as your Flutter applications grow in size and complexity, maintaining high code quality becomes crucial. Here’s why SOLID principles are important in Flutter development:

- **Improved Maintainability**
  
SOLID principles help you structure your code in a way that makes it easier to maintain and extend. This is particularly important in larger Flutter projects where multiple developers might work on the same codebase.

- **Better Testability**
  
Writing testable code is easier when following SOLID principles. For example, the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) encourages you to decouple your components, which in turn makes testing simpler and more isolated.

- **Cleaner Code**
  
SOLID principles guide you toward writing clean, readable, and understandable code, making it easier for you and others to collaborate. This results in fewer bugs and faster debugging when issues arise.

- **Scalability**
  
As you add more features to your app, following SOLID principles allows you to extend and modify your code without introducing regressions or breaking existing functionality. This is crucial when scaling Flutter applications.

- **Reusability**
  
Code that follows SOLID principles is generally more reusable. For instance, the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) ensures that your classes are open for extension but closed for modification, allowing you to reuse and adapt existing code.

By applying these principles in your Flutter projects, you ensure your codebase is not only robust and scalable but also easier to work with over time. Whether you’re building a small app or a large enterprise-level project, following SOLID principles will help you write better Flutter code.

### Disadvantages :
---

- **Steep learning curve :** 

Adopting SOLID principles requires a deep understanding of object-oriented programming, which may be challenging for some developers.

- **Overhead :**

Applying SOLID principles may require more time and effort during development.

- **Inflexibility :**

SOLID principles are guidelines, not strict rules, but some developers may treat them as such, leading to inflexible code.

---
## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) : 

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) can be summarized as :

 **"Do One Thing, and Do It Well."**

This principle emphasizes that a class, module, or function should be responsible for only one specific task. Each unit of code should have a single, well-defined responsibility and should focus exclusively on fulfilling that responsibility.

* Main concept :
  
  **"There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."**

This means a class should change only if there’s a modification to the single responsibility it owns. If a class is responsible for more than one task, changes to any of those tasks could impact the class, leading to increased complexity and a higher likelihood of bugs.

### Example :

If you have a SalesInvoice class responsible for managing invoices, it should contain only logic related to invoices:

**Good Example (SRP Compliant) :**

``` dart

class SalesInvoice {
  void generateInvoice() {
    // Logic to generate invoice
  }

  void calculateTotal() {
    // Logic to calculate invoice total
  }
}

```
Here, the SalesInvoice class is responsible only for invoice-related tasks.

**Bad Example (Violates SRP) :**

``` dart

class SalesInvoice {
  void generateInvoice() {
    // Logic to generate invoice
  }

  void calculateTotal() {
    // Logic to calculate invoice total
  }

  void sendInvoiceByEmail() {
    // Logic to send invoice via email (This violates SRP)
  }
}

```
In this case, the SalesInvoice class now has two responsibilities:

1. Managing invoices.
2. Sending emails.

This violates the SRP because now the class could change for two reasons : 

if the invoice logic changes or if the email-sending logic needs modification.

**Main point :**

- **A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job.**

By adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle:

Your code becomes easier to maintain.

Changes can be made in isolation, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

The code is more reusable and easier to test.

## Why is SRP Important in Flutter ??

Flutter projects often involve building widgets, managing state, and interacting with APIs. Mixing multiple responsibilities in a single class or widget can lead to :

* Tight coupling : Changes in one responsibility may impact another.

* Difficulty in debugging : When an issue arises, it's harder to pinpoint the source of the problem.

* Reduced reusability : A class with multiple responsibilities is less likely to be reused.


**By following SRP, you create a cleaner separation of concerns, leading to a more organized codebase.**

**Example** 

* Problem: Violating SRP :

Consider a UserProfileWidget that handles :

Displaying the UI.

Fetching user data from an API.

Managing local state for editing profile details.

``` dart

class UserProfileWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final UserService userService = UserService();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final user = userService.fetchUser(); // Fetching user data
    return Column(
      children: [
        Text("Name: ${user.name}"), // Displaying user data
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            userService.updateUser(user); // Updating user details
          },
          child: Text("Save"),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

```
This widget violates SRP because it handles UI rendering, data fetching, and updating the user profile in one place.

**Solution : Applying SRP**

* We can refactor this code to separate responsibilities :

UserService : Responsible for data fetching and updating.

UserProfileViewModel : Manages the state for the user profile.

UserProfileWidget : Focuses solely on UI rendering.

``` dart
// 1. UserService: Handles API interaction
class UserService {
  Future<User> fetchUser() async {
    // Fetch user from API
    return User(name: "John Doe");
  }

  Future<void> updateUser(User user) async {
    // Update user via API
  }
}

// 2. UserProfileViewModel: Manages state
class UserProfileViewModel extends ChangeNotifier {
  final UserService _userService;
  User? user;

  UserProfileViewModel(this._userService);

  Future<void> loadUser() async {
    user = await _userService.fetchUser();
    notifyListeners();
  }

  Future<void> saveUser(User updatedUser) async {
    await _userService.updateUser(updatedUser);
    user = updatedUser;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

// 3. UserProfileWidget: Displays UI
class UserProfileWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final UserProfileViewModel viewModel;

  UserProfileWidget({required this.viewModel});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder(
      future: viewModel.loadUser(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
          return CircularProgressIndicator();
        } else if (viewModel.user == null) {
          return Text("Error loading user");
        } else {
          final user = viewModel.user!;
          return Column(
            children: [
              Text("Name: ${user.name}"), // Only renders UI
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  viewModel.saveUser(user); // Delegates responsibility
                },
                child: Text("Save"),
              ),
            ],
          );
        }
      },
    );
  }
}

```
- **Responsibility separation : Each class in the refactored example has a single responsibility.**
 
- **Testability: With SRP, you can test UserService, UserProfileViewModel, and UserProfileWidget independently.**
  
- **Maintainability: Changes to the UI, state management, or data fetching can be made in isolation.**

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) : 

**What is the Open/Closed Principle ?**

"Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

* Closed for modification : Once written and tested, the original code should not be changed.
  
* Open for extension : New functionality should be added by extending the existing code, not by modifying it.

  This means that you should be able to extend the behavior of a class or a module without modifying its existing code. In other words, you should write code that can grow through extension rather than by altering its existing structure.


## Why is OCP Important in Flutter ?

In Flutter development, adhering to OCP helps to :

- **Enhance code scalability :** You can add new features without modifying the existing code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
  
- **Improve maintainability :** The original code remains untouched, making it easier to manage.
  
- **Facilitate testing :** Since the existing code isn’t modified, you don’t need to retest it, which can save significant time and effort.
  

 ## How to Achieve OCP ?

 **You can implement the Open/Closed Principle using two primary approaches :**

 **1. Abstract Classes :**
 
 Create a base class with common functionality and allow child classes to extend and implement additional behaviors.


 **2. Interfaces :**

 Define an interface with specific methods that can be implemented by multiple classes, enabling each class to have its own version of the behavior.

 ### Example :
 
 Let’s say we have a NotificationService that sends notifications. Initially, it only supports sending emails.

 **Problem Violating OCP :**
 
The NotificationService class directly handles email notifications. If we need to add SMS notifications, we would have to modify the NotificationService class, which violates OCP.


``` dart

class NotificationService {
  void sendEmail(String message) {
    print('Sending email: $message');
  }
}


```
**Why does this violate OCP ?**

- **Increased risk of bugs :** Modifying the existing logic may unintentionally break other functionalities.

- **Adding a new type of notification (e.g., SMS) requires modifying this class :**

``` dart
  // Modified NotificationService (Violates OCP)
class NotificationService {
  void sendEmail(String message) {
    print('Sending email: $message');
  }

  void sendSms(String message) { // Modification
    print('Sending SMS: $message');
  }
}
```

  **Solution : Applying OCP using Abstract Class :**
  
 * Note : Dart does not have a separate keyword for interfaces. Instead, an abstract class with only method signatures (no implementation) acts as an interface.

  We can apply the Open/Closed Principle by introducing an abstract class that defines the contract for sending notifications. Each type of notification will have its own class that implements this abstract class. The NotificationService will then work with any notification type without needing modification.
  

1. Create an abstract class Notification :

``` dart
abstract class Notification {
  void send(String message);
}
```
We can refactor the code by introducing an abstract class Notification that defines the contract for sending notifications. Now, NotificationService depends on the Notification abstract class rather than concrete implementations.

``` dart
// Abstract class defining the contract (acts as an interface)
abstract class Notification {
  void send(String message); // Abstract method
}

// EmailNotification class implementing the Notification interface
class EmailNotification implements Notification {
  @override
  void send(String message) {
    print('Sending email: $message');
  }
}

// SmsNotification class implementing the Notification interface
class SmsNotification implements Notification {
  @override
  void send(String message) {
    print('Sending SMS: $message');
  }
}

// NotificationService depends on the abstract Notification class
class NotificationService {
  final Notification notification;

  NotificationService(this.notification);

  void sendNotification(String message) {
    notification.send(message);
  }
}

void main() {
  // Using EmailNotification
  NotificationService emailService = NotificationService(EmailNotification());
  emailService.sendNotification('Hello via Email!');

  // Using SmsNotification without modifying NotificationService
  NotificationService smsService = NotificationService(SmsNotification());
  smsService.sendNotification('Hello via SMS!');
}
```
NotificationService is now closed for modification. We don’t need to modify it to add new types of notifications.

It’s open for extension by creating new classes (PushNotification, SlackNotification) that implement the Notification interface.

**By using abstract classes and interfaces effectively, you can design your Flutter applications to be flexible, maintainable, and compliant with the Open/Closed Principle.**

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) : 

 **The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that :**
 
 **If class B inherits from class A, then class A should be replaceable by class B without any changes to the program's functionality.**

 LSP is a concept focused on inheritance and can be considered an extension of the Open/Closed Principle (OCP). While OCP emphasizes the ability to add new functionality to a class without altering the existing code, LSP takes this a step further. It ensures that subclasses can replace their superclasses without causing issues in the system.


 In other words, when class B inherits from class A, anywhere that class A is used, class B can be used in its place without introducing errors or unexpected behavior. This guarantees that the subclass (B) behaves consistently with the superclass (A), preserving the expected behavior.

 **How LSP Extends OCP ?**
 
 The Open/Closed Principle allows for extending a class with new functionality without modifying the existing code. LSP builds on this principle by ensuring that these extensions (i.e., subclasses) can be safely substituted for the parent class, ensuring that the system remains correct and predictable.

 In simpler terms, LSP ensures that subclasses can seamlessly replace their parent classes without affecting the overall system's integrity, making it easier to extend and maintain the codebase.

 ## Why LSP is Important ?

 LSP promotes correctness and reusability in our code. It ensures that when we use inheritance, we maintain the behavior expected of the base class even when using subclasses. This principle helps avoid scenarios where substituting a subclass for its superclass introduces unexpected behavior or causes runtime errors.

  ### Violating LSP : A Bad Example 

  Consider a Bird class with a method fly(). If we create a subclass Penguin that doesn't have the ability to fly, substituting a Bird object with a Penguin object would break the expected behavior.

``` dart

class Bird {
  void fly() {
    print('Flying');
  }
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
  @override
  void fly() {
    // Penguins can't fly, so this violates LSP
    throw Exception('Penguins cannot fly');
  }
}

void main() {
  Bird bird = Penguin();
  bird.fly();  // Exception: Penguins cannot fly
}
```
In the example above, the Penguin subclass introduces unexpected behavior, breaking the Liskov Substitution Principle.

### Correct Use of LSP : A Good Example

To comply with LSP, we can design the system such that Penguin does not override the fly() method. Instead, we can define separate behavior for birds that can fly (like a Sparrow) and birds that cannot (like a Penguin).

``` dart
// Interface for flying
abstract class Flyable {
  void fly();
}

class Bird {
  String name;

  Bird(this.name);
}

class Sparrow extends Bird implements Flyable {
  Sparrow(String name) : super(name);

  @override
  void fly() {
    print('$name is flying');
  }
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
  Penguin(String name) : super(name);

  void swim() {
    print('$name is swimming');
  }
}

void main() {
  Bird sparrow = Sparrow('Sparrow');
  Bird penguin = Penguin('Penguin');

  if (sparrow is Flyable) {
    (sparrow as Flyable).fly();  // Correct behavior for sparrows
  }

  if (penguin is Penguin) {
    penguin.swim();  // Correct behavior for penguins
  }
}
```

In this example :

- **The Sparrow class implements the Flyable interface and provides a correct implementation of the fly() method.**
  
- **The Penguin class does not implement the Flyable interface, as penguins cannot fly, thus preserving the LSP.**
  
By doing this, we ensure that we can substitute a Bird with either a Sparrow or a Penguin without violating the Liskov Substitution Principle. 

**By adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle, you ensure that your Flutter application remains flexible, maintainable, and robust. Properly designed subclasses help prevent the introduction of unexpected bugs when extending functionality, enabling you to build scalable and reliable software.**

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) : 

**"Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use."**

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is closely related to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). While SRP ensures that a class has only one responsibility, ISP focuses on ensuring that an interface contains only methods that are relevant and cohesive for a specific functionality or logical grouping.


The principle emphasizes separating unrelated functionalities into smaller, more focused interfaces. Each interface should contain methods or operations that are related to a single concern or logic. This ensures that the client implementing the interface only needs to implement the methods they actually need, without being forced to implement unnecessary ones.

## Why Is ISP Important ?

- **Improves Maintainability :** Smaller interfaces are easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
  
- **Reduces Unused Code :** Classes are not forced to implement unnecessary methods that don't apply to them.

- **Enhances Flexibility :** Promotes a clean and modular design, making the code easier to refactor and extend.

- **Avoid Fat Interfaces :**
  
  A fat interface is an interface or class that contains all possible methods for various functionalities, even if they are not related. This leads to bloated, oversized interfaces that force classes to implement methods they don’t need.

### Why is this a problem ?

It violates the principle of cohesion because the interface is handling multiple unrelated concerns.

It increases the complexity of the implementing class and makes the code harder to maintain.

### Solution :
  
Split the large interface into smaller, more focused interfaces, where each interface is responsible for a specific, cohesive set of operations.

### Example : Violating ISP  

Consider a Flutter app where different types of notifications are displayed : Email Notifications and Push Notifications.

Problem : A single interface Notification forces both notification types to implement methods they don’t need.

``` dart
// Single Interface (Violates ISP)
abstract class Notification {
  void sendEmail();    // Only relevant for email notifications
  void sendPush();     // Only relevant for push notifications
}

class EmailNotification implements Notification {
  @override
  void sendEmail() {
    print("Sending email notification...");
  }

  @override
  void sendPush() {
    // Not applicable
    throw UnimplementedError("EmailNotification does not support push notifications.");
  }
}

class PushNotification implements Notification {
  @override
  void sendPush() {
    print("Sending push notification...");
  }

  @override
  void sendEmail() {
    // Not applicable
    throw UnimplementedError("PushNotification does not support email notifications.");
  }
}
```

What's Wrong ?

Both EmailNotification and PushNotification are forced to implement methods they do not use, leading to unnecessary code and potential runtime errors.

### Solution : Applying ISP

Split the Notification interface into two smaller, more specific interfaces : EmailNotificationInterface and PushNotificationInterface.

``` dart
// Separate Interfaces (Follows ISP)
abstract class EmailNotificationInterface {
  void sendEmail();
}

abstract class PushNotificationInterface {
  void sendPush();
}

// EmailNotification only implements the email-related interface
class EmailNotification implements EmailNotificationInterface {
  @override
  void sendEmail() {
    print("Sending email notification...");
  }
}

// PushNotification only implements the push-related interface
class PushNotification implements PushNotificationInterface {
  @override
  void sendPush() {
    print("Sending push notification...");
  }
}

void main() {
  EmailNotification emailNotification = EmailNotification();
  emailNotification.sendEmail();  // Correct behavior

  PushNotification pushNotification = PushNotification();
  pushNotification.sendPush();  // Correct behavior
}
```

### Benefits of Applying ISP

- **No Unnecessary Methods :**

Each class only implements the methods it needs.

- **Better Code Organization :**

Smaller, focused interfaces make the code easier to understand and maintain.

- **Improved Testability :**

Smaller interfaces allow for more targeted unit tests.

- **Flexible Extensions :**

New notification types (e.g., SMS) can be added without modifying existing interfaces or classes.

**Main Concept :**

* The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) ensures that classes are only responsible for methods they need.
  
* By breaking down large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones, you reduce complexity, improve maintainability, and adhere to a clean architecture.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) : 

**"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."**

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) focuses on reducing the coupling between high-level (business logic) and low-level (implementation details) components in your code. This is achieved by relying on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations.

- **High-Level Modules :**
  
These are the components responsible for the main logic of the application.
Example: A service that processes orders in an e-commerce app.

- **Low-Level Modules :**
  
These are the components responsible for handling specific tasks like database access, API calls, etc.
Example: A class that interacts with a database to store or retrieve order information.

- **Abstractions :**
  
Interfaces or abstract classes that define contracts for how components should interact. This decouples high-level modules from low-level details.

### Why DIP is Important ?

**Decouples Code :** High-level components are not tightly coupled to low-level implementations, making the system easier to maintain and extend.

**Improves Flexibility :** Switching or modifying low-level implementations doesn't affect the high-level logic.

**Enhances Testability :** High-level modules can be tested independently using mock implementations of the dependencies.

### Example : Violating DIP

In this example, the OrderService depends directly on a concrete SqlOrderRepository, violating the Dependency Inversion Principle :

``` dart
// Low-level module (concrete class)
class SqlOrderRepository {
  void saveOrder(String order) {
    print("Saving order to SQL database: $order");
  }
}

// High-level module (depends on low-level module)
class OrderService {
  final SqlOrderRepository repository;

  OrderService(this.repository);

  void processOrder(String order) {
    repository.saveOrder(order);
  }
}

void main() {
  SqlOrderRepository repository = SqlOrderRepository();
  OrderService service = OrderService(repository);

  service.processOrder("Order #1");
}
```
* Problem :

The OrderService class is tightly coupled to the SqlOrderRepository.

If we need to switch to a different database (e.g., NoSQL), we need to modify the OrderService, violating the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) as well.

### Solution : Applying DIP

We can refactor the code by introducing an abstraction (OrderRepository interface) that both the high-level and low-level modules depend on :

``` dart
// Abstraction (Interface)
abstract class OrderRepository {
  void saveOrder(String order);
}

// Low-level module (depends on abstraction)
class SqlOrderRepository implements OrderRepository {
  @override
  void saveOrder(String order) {
    print("Saving order to SQL database: $order");
  }
}

// Another low-level module (depends on abstraction)
class NoSqlOrderRepository implements OrderRepository {
  @override
  void saveOrder(String order) {
    print("Saving order to NoSQL database: $order");
  }
}

// High-level module (depends on abstraction, not implementation)
class OrderService {
  final OrderRepository repository;

  OrderService(this.repository);

  void processOrder(String order) {
    repository.saveOrder(order);
  }
}

void main() {
  // Dependency injection
  OrderRepository sqlRepository = SqlOrderRepository();
  OrderService service = OrderService(sqlRepository);

  service.processOrder("Order #1");

  // Switching to NoSQL repository without changing OrderService
  OrderRepository noSqlRepository = NoSqlOrderRepository();
  service = OrderService(noSqlRepository);

  service.processOrder("Order #2");
}
```

### Benefits of Applying DIP :

**Loose Coupling :**

High-level modules (OrderService) are not dependent on specific implementations, making the code more modular and flexible.

**Ease of Maintenance :**

Changes to low-level modules (e.g., switching from SQL to NoSQL) do not require modifications to high-level modules.

**Improved Testability :**

High-level modules can be easily tested by passing mock or fake implementations of the interfaces.

**Main Points :**
Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

Both high-level and low-level modules should rely on interfaces or abstract classes.

Use Dependency Injection to pass dependencies at runtime, making the code more flexible and maintainable.


``` dart
abstract class NotificationService {
  void sendNotification(String message);
}
